### Features in the App

- The [**useEffect**](https://github.com/venky4c/memory-matching-game/blob/master/dist/src/App.tsx) hook shines brightest in this project as it is used in three different situations where the render needs to happen on update of different useState variables
> Typescript is used in this project which takes care of the different props types being passed to each Card Component in a graceful manner.
